# Alnico

![Alnico](doc/alnico.jpg)

*Alnico*, a rigorously tested TypeScript library under development, explores the potential of
combining functional programming principles with the modular composition strengths of
object-oriented programming. Inspired by functional programming concepts, it aims to contribute a
new perspective on code structure and organization by eschewing the use of `this` and `new` keywords
in
favor of composable states and methods bundled into single units.
